  abstract = {We find ourselves in a media‐intensive milieu comprising networks, images, sounds, and text, which we generalize as data and metadata. How can we understand this digital milieu and make sense of these data, not only focusing on their functionalities but also reflecting on our everyday life and existence? How do these material constructions demand a new philosophical understanding? Instead of following the reductionist approaches, which understand the digital milieu as abstract entities such as information and data, this article proposes to approach it from an embodied perspective: objects. The article contrasts digital objects with natural objects (e.g., apples on the table) and technical objects (e.g., hammers) in phenomenological investigations, and proposes to approach digital objects from the concept of “relations,” on the one hand the material relations that are concretized in the development of mark‐up languages, such as SGML, HTML, and XML, and on the other hand, Web ontologies, the temporal relations that are produced and conditioned by the artificial memories of data.},

  abstract = {Dadurch, dass in Ontologien beliebige Relationen verwendet werden können (Peters & Weller, 2008), funktioniert auch das Verbinden ganz anders als beispielsweise das Zusammenführen mehrerer klassischer Datenbanken. Wie auch bei dem Verbinden von hierarchischen Ordnungssystemen können ähnliche Klassen gefunden und gegebenenfalls zusammengeführt werden. Der automatische Vergleich von Relationen untereinander wird erleichtert, falls diese formal beschrieben wurden. Viele Ansätze für das Verbinden von Ontologien berücksichtigen leider nicht beide Aspekte des Zusammenführens: Es gibt sowohl schema-based Ansätze, die sich nur auf ein gesamtes Schema, das eine Ontologie repräsentiert konzentrieren, als auch instance-based Ansätze, bei denen einzelne Elemente miteinander verbunden werden (Lanzenberger & Sampson, 2008).},

This essay connects a symmetrical archaeology to major trends in the discipline since the 1960s and to key components of archaeological practice – relational ontologies, mixtures of past and present, people and things, biology and culture, individual and society. Symmetrical archaeology is a culmination of effort in archaeology to undercut these modernist dualities and to recognize the vitality of the present past. Symmetry adds new force to the claim that archaeologists have a unique perspective on human engagements with things, on social agency and constructions of contemporary identity.},

  abstract = {Language users never choose words randomly, and language is essentially non-random. Statistical hypothesis testing uses a null hypothesis, which posits randomness. Hence, when we look at linguistic phenomena in corpora, the null hypothesis will never be true. Moreover, where there is enough data, we shall (almost) always be able to establish that it is not true. In corpus studies, we frequently do have enough data, so the fact that a relation between two phenomena is demonstrably non-random, does not support the inference that it is not arbitrary. We present experimental evidence of how arbitrary associations between word frequencies and corpora are systematically non-random. We review literature in which hypothesis testing has been used, and show how it has often led to unhelpful or misleading results.},

  abstract = {Comparison of graph structure is a ubiquitous task in data analysis and machine learning, with diverse applications in fields such as neuroscience, cyber security, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, among others. Discovery and comparison of structures such as modular communities, rich clubs, hubs, and trees yield insight into the generative mechanisms and functional properties of the graph. Often, two graphs are compared via a pairwise distance measure, with a small distance indicating structural similarity and vice versa. Common choices include spectral distances and distances based on node affinities. However, there has of yet been no comparative study of the efficacy of these distance measures in discerning between common graph topologies at different structural scales. In this work, we compare commonly used graph metrics and distance measures, and demonstrate their ability to discern between common topological features found in both random graph models and real world networks. We put forward a multi-scale picture of graph structure wherein we study the effect of global and local structures on changes in distance measures. We make recommendations on the applicability of different distance measures to the analysis of empirical graph data based on this multi-scale view. Finally, we introduce the Python library NetComp that implements the graph distances used in this work.},
