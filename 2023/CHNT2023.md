#### From Paper to Data | Bringing old archives up to date
(Eva Steigberger)

* Presented Heritage Information System ([HERIS](https://www.bda.gv.at/service/heris.html)) of the Austrian Bundesdenkmalamt (BDA)
  * Database with content from previous 'Funddatenbank' (since 1993) and GIS data
  * various shapefile available for representing internal historic stuff, current find spot, the actual 'Schutzzone'
  * For GIS: Cooperation with geographic public authorities of Burgenland, Vorarlberg, Oberösterreich, Steiermark, and Tirol; Vienna is and will not be part because of differing legislation
  * Information available for public: location (including coordinates), dating, and categorisation -> Ask: Does BDA have dedicated vocabularies for this? 
* Digital collection of photographies is managed with Goobi (a plugin for HERIS was developed, see [Goobi documentation](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-workflow-plugins-de/step/intranda_step_herisimport))
  * in-house use
* The BDA has a newly established ['Abteilung für Digitalisierung und Wissensmanagement'](https://www.bda.gv.at/ueber-uns/organisation0/verwaltungsbereich/digitalisierung.html)
  * access other repositories

#### Circular economy! | Strategies for Data Management and Usage in ZMWS/UWK & LSNÖ
(Martin Baer, Jakob Maurer)

* Presented databases for the [Landessammlungen in Niederösterreich](https://www.landessammlungen-noe.at/de/home.html) with about 7 mio objects.
  * Use [TMS Collections from Gallerysystems](https://www.gallerysystems.com/solutions/collections-management/)
  * Additionally a dedicated database for finds: Funddatenbank, Fundjournal
  * another dedicated database for 3D objects: [Kulturdatenbank](https://kulturdatenbank.at/)
  * Thesaurus: [InventARCH](https://doi.org/10.48341/tqyf-fx25)
* Propose considering Reflect, Repurpose, and Repair to avoid data 'waste'
* Jakob Maurer: Modellversuch zur Nutzung von Fundstellen IDs des Bundesdenkmalamtes als Gazetter für museale ... (reference title not complete, not able to find it via Google)

 #### Sustainable Applications for Sustainable Data at the Austrian Archaeological Institute
 (Helmut Schwaiger, Karl Burkhart, Micheline Welte)

 * Refuse: avoid new software, databases etc. Instead, use existing things, e.g. ÖAI has OeAIdam for images
 * Reduce: Make decisions (early)!
   * standardise! use vocabularies whenever possible instead of free text
   * ÖAI is building thesauri, e.g [Cultural Time Periods ](https://vocabs.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/oeai-cp/en/), more to come
   * applications should be planned so that they can include materials from future projects
 * Reuse: search what is already there; ÖAW has [Academy-CATalogPlus](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/resources/)
 * Recycle: 'upcycle' old data or applications, e.g. [dFMRÖ - digitale Fundmünzen der Römischen Zeit in Österreich](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/oeai/forschung/altertumswissenschaften/numismatik/dfmroe) is being extended
 * Rot: obsolete data or incorrect data doesn't have to be kept

### PhD/ Master Session
(Nadine Alpino, Abrahamse)

#### 3D modelling and Visual Documentation Methods: Showcasing Neolithic Art from Turkey
(Alnafouri)

 * How to present 3D models in museums, interactively and with a focus on children

#### Integrating Material Formations in Digital Models of Architectural Ornaments | A Process-Based Approach to Documenting Anatolian Stone Carvings
(Hamzaoglu & Ozkar)

 * parametric reconstruction

#### The Redesign of two incomplete interwar buildings: 32 & 34 Egnatia Str. | Restoration and reuse of Eclecticist buildings in Thessaloniki
(Katsangelou & Dousi:)

* Presentation by an architect about a more recent building in Thessaloniki
* Tried out AI for reconstruction inspiration of the front and possible floor plans, as well as renderings
  * Doesn't have a problem with emergence and use of AI, not a threat for architects because humans still needed

#### A flood risk assessment of Indus civilization sites in Gujarat, India, using Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Geographic Information System (GIS)
(Kadapa)

#### The Global Positioning System in the Local Cultural Heritage Mediation	
(Nirnbergová)

* Evaluated digital tools used at schools in the Czech Republic to teach about local cultural heritage
* Focus on a tool she developed for geocaching
  * Done with the [Whereigo toolset](https://wherigo.com/)

#### Challenges in Urban Archaeology in Tbilisi (Gudiashvili Square as a source of Medieval Ages Urbanism)
(Butsuradze)

* Research about mediaeval cellars in Tbilisi, Georgia
* no 'new technologies' used, just mentioned that they want to use them

## 2023-11-17

### Emotions in Cultural Heritage – How culture influences olfactory sense, spaces and emotions? (Keynote)
(Deepika Murty)

* Studied odors in her house for 'normal' and festive days
* Mapped them and assigned colours depending on which emotions the various family members associate with them

### Fair reuse of archive data
(Steven Stead, Jansen)

* session about FAIR data

#### ADED – Sharing excavation documentation
(Uleberg & Indgjerd & Kristensen & Samdal)

* [ADED - Archaeological Digital Excavation Documentation](https://aded.unimus.no/)
  * has a REST API that can also be connected with QGIS
  * metadata mappings to CIDOC CRM and [RO-CRATE](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/)  
* Fieldwork in Norway is done by the state
* [Five museums](https://unimus.no/) also do prehistoric excavations
  * Database for all finds: https://unimus.no/portal/
  * 2006: Representatives of the museums met but no good digital solution agreed upon
  * 2009: new group that then started the MUSIT infrastructure and aimed at the work for a common solution for fieldwork documentation
  * Disadvantages and benefits were weighted out
    * Decided to buy a system: [Intrasis](https://www.intrasis.com/)
    * good until 2011
    * data was in a 'dead' folder
    * --> share data! resulted in the creation of ADED from 2016 onwards
* 'floating fleet of archaeologists': no excavations are done in winter
* Still much to do:
  * import old digital data
  * digitise analogue data
  * add data from [NIKU](https://www.niku.no/en/) and [Maritime Museum](https://marmuseum.no/en)
  * add data from smaller county excavations

#### Colonial archive F.A.I.R.ytales
(Weschenfelder)
