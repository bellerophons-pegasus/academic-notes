* [Abstract](https://go-indigo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/goINDIGO23_abstractBonadioEgeland.pdf)
* The right of communication to the public
> artists are in opposition to the established ...
> copyright is for loosers
* moral rights?

### Discussion round: Get it out: the how and why of graffiti dissemination
* Museums also disseminate images by artists
* Postings on instagram usually publication of legal pieces
> documentation develops with age
> if you paint in a public space, you paint for the public
* unknown public | interested people | people that resonate
* pseudonyms vs. remaining anonymous
  * pseudonyms often link to websites or instagram accounts
* INDIGO: photos from processing point of view, not artistic
